%% Laplace's Equation - Part 1: One Dimensional Case 
% The first part of this problem is a solution to Laplace's equation along
% a 1-D section of a material with one side connected to a voltage source
% and the other end grounded. We expect to have a linear solution here. We
% are not using boundary conditions where the derivative of the p
